# Work-Day-Scheduler (Module 5 Challenge)

## Description

This Module 5 Challenge was given to me to complete. The goal was to build a daily calender with the typical working hours (9am-5pm) for users to fill out as needed. The calender will reflect the proper date.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use this webpage, you can add your to-do tasks or a list of items you need to complete throughout the day to your personal work day scheduler. The scheduler will reflect the current date and time when you are using the application. Previous hour rows will show in grey, the current hour row will show in green, and the future hour rows will show in red, for an easier use of the application. You can click into any time block row to create your task or note. The saved tasks will stay on the page, even after refresh, until you mark that task as complete.

## Credits

I worked on this project with my study group peers, Chase Seeberger and Will Schickler. The starter code was provided to me by University of Oregon bootcamp.
